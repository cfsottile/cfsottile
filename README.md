I am a PhD Student at Universidad de Buenos Aires and member of the LoReL (Logic and Rewriting for Programming Languages) team. I work in the elaboration of new techniques for proving termination of programs (strong normalization) in different variants of typed lambda calculus, and in the design and implementation of programming languages equating isomorphic types.
