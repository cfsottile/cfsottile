I am a PhD Student at Universidad de Buenos Aires, working on the design of functional languages equating isomorphic types.
I am currently working on the Strong Normalization property of a System F modulo isomorphisms, which led me to try to develop a novel technique to proof SN in System F without the need of reducibility candidates.
